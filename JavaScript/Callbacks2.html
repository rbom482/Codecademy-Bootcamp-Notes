      # Callback Hell (Pyramid of doom): The structure formed when a callback function is within another callback function and the pattern continues ...
        - This is a disadvantage of callbacks
        - Hence, the alternative approaches of handling asynchonous code are promises and async-await

        - Example: Order tracking app
          - Instantly: Order confirmed ✅
          - After 2 seconds: Order is being prepared 🍜
          - After 10 seconds: Order prepared 🎉
          - After 5 seconds: Order handed over to the delivery person 📦
          - After 3 seconds: Order is on the way 🚴
          - After 8 seconds: Order reached it's destination 📍
          - After 4 seconds: Order has been delivered 😋

          Total processing time for order: 32 seconds

              console.log('Order is on the way 🚴')
              setTimeout(() => {
                console.log(`Order reached it's destination 📍`)
                setTimeout(() => {
                  console.log(`Order has been delivered 😋`)
